 Biomolecular Crystallographic Computing with Jupyter
=======================================================================

.. class:: abstract

The ease of use of Jupyter notebooks has helped biologists enter scientific computing, especially in protein crystallography, where a collaborative community develops extensive libraries, user-friendly GUIs, and Python APIs.
The APIs allow users to use the libraries in Jupyter.
To further advance this use of Jupyter, we developed a collection of code fragments that use the vast Computational Crystallography Toolbox library for novel analyses.
We made versions of this library for use in JupyterLab and Colab.
We also made versions of the snippet library for the text editors VS Code, Vim, and Emacs that support editing live code cells in Jupyter notebooks via GhostText.
Readers of this paper may be inspired to adapt this latter capability to their domains of science.

 Introduction
================

Biomolecular crystallography involves the determination of the molecular structure of proteins and nucleic acids and their complexes by using X-rays, neutrons, or electrons.
The molecular structures determines the protein's biological function, so the experimentally determined structures provide valuable insights vital for understanding biology and to developing new therapies in medicine.
The recent *resolution revolution* in cryo-EM and the breakthrough in protein prediction with deep learning models now provide complimentary sources of insights to biomolecular structure, but the crystallographic approach continues to remain vital because it still supplies the most precise structures [[Kuhlbrandt14]_.

Biological crystallographers are familiar with Jupyter's browser-based environment and interactive cells, especially after ColabFold enabled running AlphaFold2 from Colab notebooks [Col.
Nonetheless, most protein crystallographers continue to use well-developed, user friendly GUIs to run crystallographic software in routine analyses.
However, these users sometimes need non-routine analyses that require new code.

The Computational Crystallography Toolbox (CCTBX) provides a vast library of computational crystallography software written in C++ and wrapped with Python.
This library is used to build new analysis tools.
CCTBX was hard to install three years ago due to its complex dependencies, but the addition of the CCTBX package to Anaconda dramatically eased the installation of CCTBX.
The lowering of this barrier to the installation of CCTBX has raised interest in the use of CCTBX for novel structure analyses.
Nonetheless, many users still find CCTBX to be impenetrable.
Several online tutorials and workshops have addressed this problem, but the adoption of CCTBX remains low.

To ease the use of CCTBX by my and other labs to develop custom crystallographic analyses, we assembled a collection of CCTBX code snippets for use in Jupyter notebooks.
Jupyter provides an excellent platform for exploring the CCTBX library and developing new analysis tools.
The Python API of CCTBX simplifies running CCTBX in Jupyter via a kernel specific for its conda environment.
We formatted the snippet library for several snippet extensions for the Classic Notebook and for Jupyter Lab.
To overcome the absence of tab triggers in the Jupyter ecosystem to invoke the insertion of snippets, we also made the snippets available for leading text editors.
The user can use the GhostText browser plugin to edit the contents of a Jupyter cell in a full-powered external editor.
GhostText enables the user to experience the joy interactive computing in Jupyter while working from the comfort of their favorite text editor.


Discussion
=============


What is new
**************

We report a set of code template libraries for doing biomolecular crystallographic computing in Jupyter.
These template libraries only need to be installed once because they persist between logins.
These templates include the code for installing the software required for crystallographic computing.
These installation templates save time because the installation process involves as many as seven operations that would be difficult to remember.
Once the user adds the installation code to the top of a given notebook, the user only needs to rerun these blocks of code upon logging into Colab to be able to reinstall the software.
The user can modify the installation templates to install the software on their local machines.
Examples of such adaptations are provided on a dedicated GitHub web page.
The template libraries presented here lower an important barrier to the use of Colab by those interested in crystallographic computing on the cloud.


Relation to other work with snippet libraries
************************************************


To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to provide snippet libraries for crystallographic computing.
This snippet library is among the first that is domain specific.
Most snippet libraries are for programming languages or for hypertext languages like HTML, markdown and LaTeX.
The average snippet also tends to be quite short and the size of the libraries tends to be quite small.
The audience for these libraries are millions of professional programmers and web page developers.
We reasoned that this great tool should be brought to the aid of the thousands of workers in crystallography.

The other area where domain specific snippets have been provided is in molecular graphics.
The pioneering work on a scripting wizard provided templates for use in the molecular graphics program RasMol [Hort99]_.
The conscript program provided a converter from RasMol to PyMOL [Mott10]_.
We also provided snippets for PyMOL, which has 100,000 users, for use in text editors [Moo21a]_ and Jupyter notebooks [Moo21b]_.
The former support tab triggers and tab stops; the latter does not.

We have also worked out how to deploy this snippet libraries in OnDemand notebooks at High-Performance Computing centers.
These notebooks resemble Colab notebooks in that JupyterLab extensions cannot be installed.
However, they do not have any alternate support for accessing snippets from menus in the GUI.
Instead, we had to create IPython magics for each snippet that load the snippet's code into the code cell.
This system would also work on Colab and may be preferred by expert users because the snippet names used to invoke magic are under autocompletetion.
That is, the user enters the start of a name and IPython suggests the remainder of the name in a pop-up menu.
We offer a variant library that inserts a commented out copy of the code that has been annotated with the sites that are to be edited by the user.



Opportunities for interoperability
************************************

The set of template libraries can encourage synergistic interoperability between software packages supported by the snippet libraries.
That is the development of notebooks that use two or more software packages and even programming languages.
More general and well-known examples of interoperability include the Cython packages in Python that enable the running of C++ code inside Python, the reticulate package that enables the running of Python code in R , and the PyCall package in Julia that enables the running of the Python packages in Julia.
The latter package is widely used to run matplotlib in Julia.
Interoperability already occurs between the CCP4, clipper, and CCTBX projects and to a limited extent between CCTBX and PyMOL, but interoperability could be more widespread if the walls around the software silos were lowered.
The snippet libraries provided here can prompt interoperability on Colab by their proximity on Colab.
