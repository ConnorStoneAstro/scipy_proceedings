  abstract     = {The primary data in X-ray diffraction experiments are images which contain bright spots known as reflections. In order to compute the electron density of the crystal which yields these reflections, the intensity of each reflection must be estimated. Redundant observations must be parsimoniously reduced to a set of summary intensities and corresponding error estimates. This task is confounded by a range of systematic effects leading to equivalent reflections being expressed on different scales. Here, we present a modern Bayesian solution to this problem, careless, which uses deep learning and variational inference to simultaneously merge and scale reflection observations. We successfully apply this method to conventional monochromatic X-ray diffraction data, polychromatic diffraction data, and finally X-ray free-electron laser data. Thereby, we find that this single model is generally applicable to many types of X-ray diffraction experiments.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

software package for macromolecular structure determination that handles data
from any of these techniques. Tasks performed with Phenix include data-quality
assessment, map improvement, model building, the validation/rebuilding/
refinement cycle and deposition. Each tool caters to the type of experimental
data. The design of Phenix emphasizes the automation of procedures, where
possible, to minimize repetitive and time-consuming manual tasks, while default
parameters are chosen to encourage best practice. A graphical user interface
provides access to many command-line features of Phenix and streamlines the
transition between programs, project tracking and re-running of previous tasks.},
