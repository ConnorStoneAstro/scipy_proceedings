Much of crystallography’s success is due to the software packages developed  to  enable  automated  processing  of  diffraction  data.  However,  the analysis  of  unconventional  diffraction  experiments  can  still  pose  significant challenges – many existing programs are closed source, sparsely documented, or challenging  to  integrate  with  modern  libraries  for  scientific  computing  and machine  learning.

  abstract     = {The primary data in X-ray diffraction experiments are images which contain bright spots known as reflections. In order to compute the electron density of the crystal which yields these reflections, the intensity of each reflection must be estimated. Redundant observations must be parsimoniously reduced to a set of summary intensities and corresponding error estimates. This task is confounded by a range of systematic effects leading to equivalent reflections being expressed on different scales. Here, we present a modern Bayesian solution to this problem, careless, which uses deep learning and variational inference to simultaneously merge and scale reflection observations. We successfully apply this method to conventional monochromatic X-ray diffraction data, polychromatic diffraction data, and finally X-ray free-electron laser data. Thereby, we find that this single model is generally applicable to many types of X-ray diffraction experiments.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

experimental data are different. Software tools for structure determination
should therefore be tailored for each method. Phenix is a comprehensive
software package for macromolecular structure determination that handles data
from any of these techniques. Tasks performed with Phenix include data-quality
assessment, map improvement, model building, the validation/rebuilding/
refinement cycle and deposition. Each tool caters to the type of experimental
data. The design of Phenix emphasizes the automation of procedures, where
possible, to minimize repetitive and time-consuming manual tasks, while default
parameters are chosen to encourage best practice. A graphical user interface
provides access to many command-line features of Phenix and streamlines the

  abstract = {{The Protein Data Bank (PDB) is the single global archive of experimentally determined three-dimensional (3D) structure data of biological macromolecules. Since 2003, the PDB has been managed by the Worldwide Protein Data Bank (wwPDB; wwpdb.org), an international consortium that collaboratively oversees deposition, validation, biocuration, and open access dissemination of 3D macromolecular structure data. The PDB Core Archive houses 3D atomic coordinates of more than 144 000 structural models of proteins, DNA/RNA, and their complexes with metals and small molecules and related experimental data and metadata. Structure and experimental data/metadata are also stored in the PDB Core Archive using the readily extensible wwPDB PDBx/mmCIF master data format, which will continue to evolve as data/metadata from new experimental techniques and structure determination methods are incorporated by the wwPDB. Impacts of the recently developed universal wwPDB OneDep deposition/validation/biocuration system and various methods-specific wwPDB Validation Task Forces on improving the quality of structures and data housed in the PDB Core Archive are described together with current challenges and future plans.}},

	abstract = {The application of sulfur single-wavelength anomalous dispersion (S-SAD) to determine the crystal structures of macromolecules can be challenging if the asymmetric unit is large, the crystals are small, the size of the anomalously scattering sulfur structure is large and the resolution at which the anomalous signals can be accurately measured is modest. Here, as a study of such a case, approaches to the SAD phasing of orthorhombic Ric-8A crystals are described. The structure of Ric-8A was published with only a brief description of the phasing process [Zeng et al. (2019), Structure , 27 , 1137–1141]. Here, alternative approaches to determining the 40-atom sulfur substructure of the 103 kDa Ric-8A dimer that composes the asymmetric unit are explored. At the data-collection wavelength of 1.77 Å measured at the Frontier micro-focusing Macromolecular Crystallography (FMX) beamline at National Synchrotron Light Source II, the sulfur anomalous signal strength, |Δ ano |/σΔ ano ( d ′′/sig), approaches 1.4 at 3.4 Å resolution. The highly redundant, 11 000 000-reflection data set measured from 18 crystals was segmented into isomorphous clusters using BLEND in the CCP 4 program suite. Data sets within clusters or sets of clusters were scaled and merged using AIMLESS from CCP 4 or, alternatively, the phenix.scale_and_merge tool from the Phenix suite. The latter proved to be the more effective in extracting anomalous signals. The HySS tool in Phenix , SHELXC / D and PRASA as implemented in the CRANK 2 program suite were each employed to determine the sulfur substructure. All of these approaches were effective, although HySS , as a component of the phenix.autosol tool, required data from all crystals to find the positions of the sulfur atoms. Critical contributors in this case study to successful phase determination by SAD included (i) the high-flux FMX beamline, featuring helical-mode data collection and a helium-filled beam path, (ii) as recognized by many authors, a very highly redundant, multiple-crystal data set and (iii) the inclusion within that data set of data from crystals that were scanned over large ω ranges, yielding highly isomorphous and highly redundant intensity measurements.},

  abstract   = {Cryo-cooling has been nearly universally adopted to mitigate X-ray damage and facilitate crystal handling in protein X-ray crystallography. However, cryo X-ray crystallographic data provide an incomplete window into the ensemble of conformations that is at the heart of protein function and energetics. Room-temperature (RT) X-ray crystallography provides accurate ensemble information, and recent developments allow conformational heterogeneity (the experimental manifestation of ensembles) to be extracted from single-crystal data. Nevertheless, high sensitivity to X-ray damage at RT raises concerns about data reliability. To systematically address this critical issue, increasingly X-ray-damaged high-resolution data sets (1.02–1.52 \AA resolution) were obtained from single proteinase K, thaumatin and lysozyme crystals at RT (277 K). In each case a modest increase in conformational heterogeneity with X-ray damage was observed. Merging data with different extents of damage (as is typically carried out) had negligible effects on conformational heterogeneity until the overall diffraction intensity decayed to ∼70% of its initial value. These effects were compared with X-ray damage effects in cryo-cooled crystals by carrying out an analogous analysis of increasingly damaged proteinase K cryo data sets (0.9–1.16  \AA resolution). X-ray damage-associated heterogeneity changes were found that were not observed at RT. This property renders it difficult to distinguish real from artefactual conformations and to determine the conformational response to changes in temperature. The ability to acquire reliable heterogeneity information from single crystals at RT, together with recent advances in RT data collection at accessible synchrotron beamlines, provides a strong motivation for the widespread adoption of RT X-ray crystallography to obtain conformational ensemble information.},
