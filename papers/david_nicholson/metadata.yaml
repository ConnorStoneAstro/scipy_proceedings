abstract:
  - How is speech like birdsong? What does it mean for animal to learn their vocalizations?
  - Questions like these are answered by studying how animals communicate with sound.
  - As in many other fields, the study of acoustic communication is being revolutionized by deep neural network models.
  - These models enable answering questions that were previously impossible to address,
  - in part because the models automate analysis of very large datasets. Acoustic communication researchers
  - have developed multiple models for similar tasks, often implemented as research code with several different libraries,
  - such as Keras and Pytorch. This situation has created a real need for a framework
  - that allows researchers to easily test models with their own data and to benchmark
  - and adapt multiple models to their use cases. To address this need, we developed vak (https://github.com/vocalpy/vak),
  - a neural network framework designed for acoustic communication researchers. Here we describe the design of the vak,
  - and explain how vak makes it easy for researchers to apply neural network models to their own data.
  - We highlight improvements made in version 1.0 that we believe will significantly improve user experience with the library.
  - To provide researchers without expertise in deep learning access to these models,
  - vak can be run via a command-line interface that uses configuration files.
  - Vak can also be used directly in scripts by scientist-coders. To achieve this, vak adopts design patterns and
  - an API from other domain-specific PyTorch libraries such as torchvision, with modules representing
  - neural network operations, models, datasets, and transformations for pre- and post-processing.
  - vak also leverages the lightning framework as a backend, so that researchers and developers can focus on the domain.
  - We provide proof-of-concept results showing how vak can be used with benchmark datasets to compare models.
  - In closing we discuss our roadmap for development and vision for the community of users.
